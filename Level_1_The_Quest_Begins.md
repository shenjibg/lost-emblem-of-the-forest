üåü Starting Level: The Quest Begins üåü
Objective: Navigate through Greenwood Forest to find the first clue to the Lost Emblem's location.

Task 1: The Bridge of Challenges

- Description: The scouts encounter a wide river blocking their path. The only way across is an old, rickety bridge with missing planks and unstable ropes. To cross safely, the scouts must use their skills and wit.
- Challenge: Each scout must choose a skill to navigate the bridge safely. Options include using Knot Tying to secure loose ropes, using Wisdom to choose the safest path, or using Strength to support weaker planks.
- Success: Safely crossing the bridge strengthens the team's bond and brings them closer to their goal. They find a carved stone on the other side, bearing part of a map leading deeper into the forest.
- Failure: If a scout fails, they might slip or cause a plank to break but are quickly helped up by their teammates, teaching the importance of teamwork and perseverance. They lose some time but learn from the experience, still finding the carved stone but with a renewed sense of caution.

Task 2: The Whispering Woods

- Description: As they venture deeper, the scouts enter a section of the forest where the trees seem to whisper secrets. It's easy to get lost here, as paths seem to shift and the whispers can confuse the unwary.
- Challenge: Using their Navigation and Intelligence, the scouts must decipher the whispers, which hint at the direction to take. They can also use their Charisma to keep morale high, ensuring no one succumbs to fear.
- Success: Mastering the whispers reveals them to be guiding voices of past scouts, leading the group to a clearing where the next clue awaits‚Äîa silver compass pointing towards the Sunstone Peak, the next location on their quest.
- Failure: Getting lost in the woods costs time and might lead to encounters with harmless but startling forest creatures, teaching the scouts the value of patience and attention to detail. Eventually, a kindly forest spirit or a calm scout using their special ability helps them find the way.
